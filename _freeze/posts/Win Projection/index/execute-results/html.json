This section should motivate the post by describing WHY it exists. It is literally ok to say it exists because we thought it was a good starting point for learning some of these tools. -->\n\n<!-- One writing framework to consider is called \"AND, BUT, THEREFORE.\" You have Fact1 AND Fact2, BUT there is a Constraint or Limitation or Problem. THEREFORE, this post exists. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\nThere are many different algorithms that try to simulate the next MLB season with a lot of complex statistics. The goal of this was to learn about this model and see how accurate a simulation can be with just a couple simple statistics taken into account.\n\nThis program simulates a 2023 season of all 162 games using the Bradley-Terry model. It uses last year's run differentials (average runs scored minus average runs allowed) to try to estimate this year's top performers.\n\n### Data\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n<!-- This section is good. You COULD add an explanatory sentence, but you don't need to. You might define the three things you create as data frames. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n`schedule1 <- read_excel(\"schedule.xlsx\")` - reads in a two column excel sheet with headers 'Home' and 'Away' and teams from each game listed below\n\n<!-- `battingstats <- read_excel(\"2022battingstats.xlsx\")` - reads in a excel sheet with 2022 MLB batting statistics for all teams -->\n\n<!-- `fieldingstats <- read_excel(\"fieldingstats2022.xlsx\")` - reads in a excel sheet with 2022 MLB fielding statistics for all teams -->\n\n2022 statistics are from [here](https://www.baseball-reference.com/leagues/majors/2022.shtml).\n\n### Calculations\n\nThe [Bradley-Terry model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bradley%E2%80%93Terry_model) is a probability model to predict outcomes of object i beating object j based on each objects ability or talent. In this instance, it is used to compare teams but it was originally to be used with players.\n\nTalent is calculated by z-scores of seasonal average run differential of each team and then divided by 10. The talents were divided by 10 to decrease variation between teams even more. It is then adjusted for home field advantage so 0.04, based on [this](https://sabr.org/journal/article/home-field-advantage/#:~:text=In%20every%20sport%20and%20at,percent%20of%20the%20games%20played.) article, is added to the probability of the home team winning.\n\nThe equation used in this project for probability is:\n\n```         \nprob.Home = exp(Talent.Home) / (exp(Talent.Home) + exp(Talent.Visitor)) + 0.04)\n```\n\nThen, that probability is plugged into another equation to calculate a winner from each game.\n\n```         \noutcome = rbinom(nrow(.), 1, prob.Home), winner = ifelse(outcome, Home, Visitor))\n```\n\nThis equation uses [rbinom](https://www.programmingr.com/examples/neat-tricks/sample-r-function/r-rbinom/) which simulates a series of Bernoulli trials and returns the results. This returns a 1 if the home team wins and a 0 if the visiting team wins.\n\n<!-- ::: callout-note -->\n<!-- This section is really good. Concise, clear, and a mostly complete set of information. I can't remember why you divide the talent Z scores by 10, so you should explain that. -->\n<!-- ::: -->\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n:::\n\n\n### One simulation\n\nOne season simulation with Wins and Losses
