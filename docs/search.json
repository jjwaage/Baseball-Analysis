In this instance, it is used to compare teams but it was originally to be used with players.\nTalent is calculated by z-scores of seasonal average run differential of each team and then divided by 10. It is then adjusted for home field advantage so 0.04, based on this article, is added to the probability of the home team winning.\nThe equation used in this project for probability is:\nprob.Home = exp(Talent.Home) / (exp(Talent.Home) + exp(Talent.Visitor)) + 0.04)\nThen, that probability is plugged into another equation to calculate a winner from each game.\noutcome = rbinom(nrow(.), 1, prob.Home), winner = ifelse(outcome, Home, Visitor))\nThis equation uses rbinom which simulates a series of Bernoulli trials and returns the results.
