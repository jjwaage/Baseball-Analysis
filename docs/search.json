    "text": "There are many different algorithms that try to simulate the next MLB season with a lot of complex statistics. The goal of this was to learn about this model and see how accurate a simulation can be with just a couple simple statistics taken into account.\nThis program simulates a 2023 season of all 162 games using the Bradley-Terry model. It uses last year’s run differentials (average runs scored minus average runs allowed) to try to estimate this year’s top performers.\n\n\n\nschedule1 &lt;- read_excel(\"schedule.xlsx\") - reads in a two column excel sheet with headers ‘Home’ and ‘Away’ and teams from each game listed below\n2022 statistics are from here.\n\n\n\nThe Bradley-Terry model is a probability model to predict outcomes of object i beating object j based on each objects ability or talent. In this instance, it is used to compare teams but it was originally to be used with players.\nTalent is calculated by z-scores of seasonal average run differential of each team and then divided by 10. The talents were divided by 10 to decrease variation between teams even more. It is then adjusted for home field advantage so 0.04, based on this article, is added to the probability of the home team winning.\nThe equation used in this project for probability is:\nprob.Home = exp(Talent.Home) / (exp(Talent.Home) + exp(Talent.Visitor)) + 0.04)\nThen, that probability is plugged into another equation to calculate a winner from each game.\noutcome = rbinom(nrow(.), 1, prob.Home), winner = ifelse(outcome, Home, Visitor))\nThis equation uses rbinom which simulates a series of Bernoulli trials and returns the results.
