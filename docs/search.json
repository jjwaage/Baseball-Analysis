    "text": "Wins above replacement (WAR) is a statistic used to show how many wins a player is worth instead of their hypothetical replacement. This compares the player to a replacement level player at the same position, such as a free agent or a minor league player. The algorithm to calculate WAR is different for position players and pitchers.\nAccording to the MLB glossary, the formula for WAR for pitchers is, “Different WAR computations use either RA9 or FIP. Those numbers are adjusted for league and ballpark. Then, using league averages, it is determined how many wins a pitcher was worth based on those numbers and his innings pitched total.”\nRA9 is runs allowed per 9 innings pitched and “FIP is similar to ERA, but it focuses solely on the events a pitcher has the most control over – strikeouts, unintentional walks, hit-by-pitches and home runs. It entirely removes results on balls hit into the field of play,” also from the MLB glossary.\nTo combat the possible difference of values from the different ways of calculating WAR for pitchers, all statistics will be taken from the same source.\n Looking at pitchers that recorded at least 20 IP, data is from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression lines shows that there is a strong positive correlation between how many wins a team gets and how high their average WAR of their pitchers is.\nHouston was the 2022 World Series Winner and they had the biggest average war. Looking at past years is that a common occurrence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLB Glossary - Wins Above Replacement (WAR)"

The goal of this was to learn about this model and see how accurate a simulation can be with just a couple simple statistics taken into account.\nThis program simulates a 2023 season of all 162 games using the Bradley-Terry model. It uses last year’s run differentials (average runs scored minus average runs allowed) to try to estimate this year’s top performers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nschedule1 &lt;- read_excel(\"schedule.xlsx\") - reads in a two column excel sheet with headers ‘Home’ and ‘Away’ and teams from each game listed below\n\n\n2022 statistics are from here.\n\n\n\nThe Bradley-Terry model is a probability model to predict outcomes of object i beating object j based on each objects ability or talent. In this instance, it is used to compare teams but it was originally to be used with players.\nTalent is calculated by z-scores of seasonal average run differential of each team and then divided by 10. The talents were divided by 10 to decrease variation between teams even more. It is then adjusted for home field advantage so 0.04, based on this article, is added to the probability of the home team winning.\nThe equation used in this project for probability is:\nprob.Home = exp(Talent.Home) / (exp(Talent.Home) + exp(Talent.Visitor)) + 0.04)\nThen, that probability is plugged into another equation to calculate a winner from each game.\noutcome = rbinom(nrow(.), 1, prob.Home), winner = ifelse(outcome, Home, Visitor))\nThis equation uses rbinom which simulates a series of Bernoulli trials and returns the results. This returns a 1 if the home team wins and a 0 if the visiting team wins.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOne season simulation with Wins and Losses from each team using the Bradley Terry model to predict each

This shows there is a strong positive correlation between my projection and the teams that are most likely to make the playoffs. This shows that it can be estimated fairly well whether or not teams make the playoffs based off of just win differential of the previous year and home field advantage.\n\n\n\nHow FiveThirtyEight does their predictions\nPlayoff Simulator\nSimulator in R\n2022 Updated Playoffs\nHome Field Advantage\nContributing Factors in Increasing Winning Percentage\n2022 Stats\n2023 Playoff Chances"

    "text": "Wins above replacement (WAR) is a statistic used to show how many wins a player is worth instead of their hypothetical replacement. This compares the player to a replacement level player at the same position, such as a free agent or a minor league player. The algorithm to calculate WAR is different for position players and pitchers.\nAccording to the MLB glossary, the formula for WAR for pitchers is, “Different WAR computations use either RA9 or FIP. Those numbers are adjusted for league and ballpark. Then, using league averages, it is determined how many wins a pitcher was worth based on those numbers and his innings pitched total.”\nRA9 is runs allowed per 9 innings pitched and “FIP is similar to ERA, but it focuses solely on the events a pitcher has the most control over – strikeouts, unintentional walks, hit-by-pitches and home runs. It entirely removes results on balls hit into the field of play,” also from the MLB glossary.\nTo combat the possible difference of values from the different ways of calculating WAR for pitchers, all statistics will be taken from the same source.\n Looking at pitchers that recorded at least 20 IP, data is from here.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe regression lines shows that there is a strong positive correlation between how many wins a team gets and how high their average WAR of their pitchers is.\nHouston was the 2022 World Series Winner and they had the biggest average war. Looking at past years is that a common occurrence?\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMLB Glossary - Wins Above Replacement (WAR)"
