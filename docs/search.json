It is then adjusted for home field advantage so 0.04, based on this article, is added to the probability of the home team winning.\nThe equation used in this project for probability is:\nprob.Home = exp(Talent.Home) / (exp(Talent.Home) + exp(Talent.Visitor)) + 0.04)\nThen, that probability is plugged into another equation to calculate a winner from each game.\noutcome = rbinom(nrow(.), 1, prob.Home), winner = ifelse(outcome, Home, Visitor))\nThis equation uses rbinom which simulates a series of Bernoulli trials and returns the results.
