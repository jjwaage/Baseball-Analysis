## How does my Projection of Playoff Contending Teams Compare to their Percentages of Making the Playoffs Every Week?


```{r}
# Load necessary libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)

# Get the list of Excel files in the directory
files <- list.files( pattern = "*.xlsx", full.names = TRUE)

# Reading and appending files using purrr
all_data <- files %>% 
  map_df(~ read_excel(.x, skip = 1) %>%
           select(Date, Post) %>%
           mutate(FileName = tools::file_path_sans_ext(basename(.x))))



```
