**If the rest of the MLB games this season were decided by a coin flip, would the Mariners make the playoffs?**

                      message = FALSE,

#### Introduction

Simulates a 2023 season of all 161 games using the Bradley-Terry model.

By repeated simulations, can explore the relationship between talent and season performance.

Talent has been edited so that it is decided by z-scores of average runs score - average runs allowed by each team and then divided by 10. 

#### Main functions

Read in two functions:

-   `one.simulation()` performs the simulation
-   `print_standings()` prints the division standings of the simulation

Reads in the data:

-   `schedule1 <- read_excel("schedule.xlsx")` reads in a two column excel sheet with headers 'Home' and 'Away' and teams from each game listed below
-   `battingstats <- read_excel("2022battingstats.xlsx")` reads in a excel sheet with 2022 MLB batting statistics for all teams
-   `fieldingstats <- read_excel("fieldingstats2022.xlsx")`reads in a excel sheet with 2022 MLB fielding statistics for all teams

    out2 <- out %>% 
      mutate(Wild.Card = 0,
      outcome = sample(nrow(.), prob = prob)) %>%

           out2[11:15, 1],  out2[11:15, 5],  out2[11:15, 8])

  colnames(al)<-c("AL East", "Wins", "Losses", "AL Cent", "Wins", "Losses",
                  "AL West", "Wins", "Losses")

   knitr::kable(al, align = "crlcrlcrl")
}

print_nl <- function(out2) {
    out2 %>%
     mutate(Losses = 161 - Wins) -> out2
  
    nl <- cbind(out2[21:25, 1], out2[21:25, 5], out2[21:25, 8],

                  "NL West", "Wins", "Losses")
    
    knitr::kable(nl, align = "crlcrlcrl")
    
}

```


Also I am adding several helper functions `increasefont()` and `centertitle()` that I will use in ggplot2.

```{r}
increasefont <- function(Size = 18){
  theme(text = element_text(size = Size))
}

centertitle <- function(Color = "blue"){
    theme(plot.title = 
            element_text(colour = Color, size = 18, 
        hjust = 0.5, vjust = 0.8, angle = 0))
}
```

#### One simulation

One season simulation with Wins and Losses from each team

```{r, echo=FALSE}
out <- one.simulation()
print_nl(out)
print_al(out)
```

#### 1000 Simulations

Store the results of 1000 simulated seasons:

```{r}
all_out <- NULL  
for(j in 1:100){
  out <- one.simulation()
  out$Simulation <- j
  all_out <- rbind(all_out, out)
}
```

#### Talent and probability of making playoffs

Define a new variable Level that is 0 (missed playoffs), 1 (wild-card), or 2 (win division).

```{r, echo = FALSE}

all_out %>%
  mutate(Level = as.factor(2 * (Winner.Div == 1) + (Wild.Card == 1))) -> all_out

playoffs <- NULL
  
all_out <- all_out %>% 
  mutate(playoffs = Winner.Div + Wild.Card)

playoffsummary <- all_out %>% 
  group_by(Team) %>% 
  summarize(playoffpercent = sum(playoffs) / 100)


```

Printing percentage of playoffs made from each team over 1000 seasons.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
colnames(playoffsummary) <- c("Team", "Percent Playoffs Made")

knitr::kable(playoffsummary)
```

Level is an ordinal response variable. Using a proportional odds model, model the ordinal response as a function of the team's talent.

For a range of talent values from -0.9 to 0.9, find the fitted model probability of the three outcomes.

```{r}
pfit <- polr(Level ~ Talent,
             data = all_out)
DF <- data.frame(Talent = seq(-0.9, 0.9,
                                  length.out = 200))
Prob <- predict(pfit, DF, type = "probs")
DF1 <- DF2 <- DF3 <- DF
DF1$Probability <- Prob[, 3]; DF1$Type <- "Division"
DF2$Probability <- Prob[, 2]; DF2$Type <- "Wild Card"
DF3$Probability <- Prob[, 3] + Prob[, 2]
DF3$Type <- "Playoff"
DFall <- rbind(DF1, DF2, DF3)
```

Graph of this division, wild card, and playoff probabilities.

```{r}
ggplot(DFall, aes(Talent, Probability,
                  color = Type)) +
  geom_line() +
  increasefont() +
  ggtitle("Probability of Reaching Different Levels") +
  centertitle()
```

#### Talents of wild card teams and division-winners

Construct density estimates of

-   all teams
-   teams that win division
-   teams that get wild card

```{r}
data1 <- filter(all_out, Wild.Card == 1) %>% 
         mutate(Type = "Wild Card")
data2 <- filter(all_out, Winner.Div == 1) %>% 
  mutate(Type = "Win Division")
data3 <- all_out %>% 
  mutate(Type = "All Teams")

ggplot(rbind(data1, data2, data3), 
       aes(Talent, color = Type)) +
  geom_density(size = 1.5) +
  increasefont() + centertitle() +
  ggtitle("Talent Distributions for Three Types of Teams")
```

#### How many games to win?

Find the conditional probability of winning division title, of getting wild card, and making the playoffs given you won X games.

```{r}
all_out %>% 
  filter(Wins >= 25, Wins <= 45) %>% 
  group_by(Wins) %>% 
  summarize(N = n(), 
            Prob_Div = mean(Winner.Div),
            Prob_WC = mean(Wild.Card),
            .groups = "drop") -> S
```

Plot smooths of these empirical probabilities.

```{r}
S %>% 
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(Wins, Prob_Div), se = FALSE,
              color = "red",
              method = "loess") +
  geom_smooth(aes(Wins, Prob_WC), se = FALSE,
              color = "blue",
              method = "loess") + 
  geom_smooth(aes(Wins, Prob_Div + Prob_WC),
                  se = FALSE,
              color = "black",
              method = "loess") +
  increasefont() +
  ylab("Probability") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 32, y = 0.75,
           label = "Playoffs", size = 7) +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 40.3, y = 0.75,
           label = "Division", size = 7,
           color = "red") +
  annotate(geom = "text", x = 40.8, y = 0.25,
           label = "Wild Card", size = 7,
           color = "blue") +
  ggtitle("How Many Games Does Team Need to Win?") +
  centertitle()
```
